  <p id="text"><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the
    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
    to make a type specimen book. <b>It has survived not only five centuries, but also</b> the leap into electronic
    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <b>It was popularised</b> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
    containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
    versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
